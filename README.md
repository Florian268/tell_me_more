# Abstract

“Tell Me More” was an App written by Florian Reihl for a 36 hour LLM hackathon at CMU in April 2023. The goal was to explore new ways of  HCI in museums to create a loop empowering the user to ask follow-up questions using GPT-4. Users would be exposed to differing perspectives on a subject, possibly countering a museum's narrative, as one judge put it, "rebellious." However, there are limitations, as the app can produce inaccuracies and hallucinations. To increase accuracy, we explored prompt engineering methods to include the exhibit's context and consider the user's age group (rewritten into an MVVM architecture after the hackathon). 

Additionally, new features planned are to allow museums to collect data what users are interested in, connect the app to a web application by George Wang for the exhibit to speak back to the user, and train a separate LLM on a digital archive and corpus. Currently, Florian is working with a team on the redesign to make the app look neater and allow text to be scanned to not depend on QR codes.
